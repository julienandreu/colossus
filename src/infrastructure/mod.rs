//! Infrastructure concerns
//!
//! This module contains infrastructure-related functionality such as
//! logging, configuration management, and other cross-cutting concerns
//! that support the application's core functionality.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The infrastructure module provides cross-cutting concerns:
//!
//! - **Logging**: Application logging and tracing
//! - **Configuration**: Application configuration management
//! - **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics
//! - **Security**: Authentication and authorization
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! // Future infrastructure usage examples will be added here
//! // as the infrastructure components are implemented
//! ```
//!
//! # TODO
//!
//! - [ ] Add logging infrastructure
//! - [ ] Add configuration management
//! - [ ] Add monitoring and metrics
//! - [ ] Add security components

// TODO: Add infrastructure implementations (logging, config, etc.)
